<h1>Use Case 10: Delete Aerial Charging point</h1>
<p>When a charging piont is due to be out of service, the system admin will remove the aerial charging point from the system. This will mean that the aerial charging piont will no longer be in use.</p>
    
<p>When a aerial charging point is due to be taken out of commistion, it is first de-registered from the system before being dismantiled. This means that I will taken off of the network of aerial charging points for drones to use. By de-registering an aerial charging point by the system admin, this will delete the reference to the aerial charging point from the database.</p>
