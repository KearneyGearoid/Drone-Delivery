<h1>Use Case 14: Track Drones</h1>
<p>A drone needs to be tracked on its location in order to keep track of it.</p>
    
<p>Track drone acts as an airtraffic control function, being able to track drones location and status. The system administrator will run the function and the program will search through the system to find each drones location and what stage of a delivery it is at, what charge it has left, identifier for the drone and where its next destination is.</p>
