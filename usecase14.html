<h1>Use Case 14: Drone Status</h1>
<p>Drone status updates the system about the status of a drone</p>
    
<p>Drone status is used to locate and update the status of a drone. The Drone Fleet Manager will run the function and search for a drone, the program will search through the system to find the drone's information and request an up date on the drones location, stage of a delivery and what charge it has left from the drone</p>
