<h1>Brief Use Case 5: Cancel Delivery</h1>
<p>The user initiates this by selecting the cancel delivery button. The system locates the drone that was assigned to the delivery.
The system then returns the drone to the original starting point where the package can be returned to sender.
The delivery is removed from the dashboard once it is has delivered the package. </p>

<h1>Casual Use Case 5: Cancel Delivery</h1>
If it can cannot be cancelled due to partial delivery then the requester will be notified. If the delivery can be cancelled then the requester will be asked to
confirm the cancellation of the delivery. If this is confirmed then the system will start the process of cancellation. The drone then gets returned to the start of the
delivery to return package. Once the package is safely returned, the drone's status is set to active. This drone can now be used in the creation of a new delivery.
This delivery will be removed from the requesters dashboard.  </p>
